This code book contains the information related to dataset, tidy.txt, created by R script run_analysis.R.

* subject: subject identifier which varies from 1 to 30.
* activity: name of activity label for which measurement were taken for each subject.


### Activity labels: There were 6 activities for which measurement were taken for each subject during the test

* WALKING: subject was walking 
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking up a staircase
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking down a staircase
* SITTING: subject was sitting 
* STANDING: subject was standing
* LAYING: subject was laying down

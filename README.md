##Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data

In this asignment I wrote a R script named as run_analysis.R. This R script perform the following operations:

* It reads the datasets from the directory where the downloaded datasets are saved.
* It load the activity and features.
* Extract the mean and standard deviation of the measurements.
* Load the training dataset.
* Load the test dataset.
* Merge the training and test datasets.
* Create a tidy.txt dataset which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
